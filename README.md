Food is an essential need for man's survival. Everyone of us at certain points has either had a best food or cravings for certain kinds of foods and would most likely go to any length to get it either by cooking or eating out.
Some of the objectives we considered in thise project include; 
What food customers like the most?
Does weather influence what people eat?
What is the preferred mode of transportation used by the restaurant? 
What time do people pick their orders most?
What is the correlation between days of the week with respect to the type of vehicle used to deliver food and the distance covered]?
The notebook on this research has more details and answers the needed qustions. Also included is a presentation file.
